# About Me

Hello. My name is Xevion and I am a Highschool Senior.

I enjoy programming as a hobby and in preparation for a career in Software Engineering.
In my free time, when I'm not programming, I alternate between Anime, The Office, Videogames and Photography.

I don't yet have a high degree of real in-depth work, so over the next couple of years as I enter college, I will be tackling
more and more projects across a variety of languages and frameworks to build my resume, and more importantly, my confidence.

# Skill

I work primarily in Python, but have recently been extending my reach to C# and the languages of the web (HTML, CSS & JS).
